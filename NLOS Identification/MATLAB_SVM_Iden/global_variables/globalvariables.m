%Attention: Whole file is unnecessary, because the values for the 'global'
%           variables are set in the specific 'get_[...]'
%           Using 'global' does not work properly, therfore this approach
%           was chosen

%No of columns in xm = nomber of different signals (in extracted form)
%global nooftrainingdata = 5;

% Number of extracted features  (A. Feature Selection)
%global nooffeatures = 6;

%TESTING VALUES
%global kleinlambda = rand(1,nootrainingdata+1);

%global x = rand(6,1);
%global xm = rand(6,5);
